# AdafruitCPXGradualVolumeIndicator
This program is meant to use the Adafruit CPX as a volume-monitoring device to help people avoid hearing loss.
The program utilizes the led ring on the Adafruit CPX to display the ambient volume. As the volume increases, more lights turn on, and the colors turn increasingly red. At or above a specified volume, the CPX starts to beep. The CPX stops beeping when the volume turns back to normal.
